Intro to Game Programming.
-------------------------

### Introduction.

Welcome to my repository for CS3113 - Intro to Game Programming. Here, I placed all of my work for the course throughout the semester. This was taken in Fall 2015 with professor Ivan Safrin.

### Technical details.

The code is all written in C++. It uses SDL 2.0 to render with OpenGL.
About half of it was written on a Windows PC with Visual Studio, the other half was written on a Mac with Xcode. This repo contains some broken code too, just for archival purposes.

### Assignment descriptions.

*  HW1 - A simple 2D scene
*  HW2 - A pong game
*  HW3 - Space Invaders
*  HW4 - Platformer game
*  HW5 - Adding sound to a previous assignment
