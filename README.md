Intro to Game Programming.
-------------------------

### Introduction.

Welcome to my repository for CS3113 - Intro to Game Programming. Here, I placed all of my work for the course throughout the semester. This was taken in Fall 2015 with professor Ivan Safrin.

### Technical details.

The code is all written in C++. It uses SDL 2.0 to render with OpenGL.
About half of it was written on a Windows PC with Visual Studio, the other half was written on a Mac with Xcode. This repo contains some broken code too, just for archival purposes.

### Assignment descriptions.

*  HW1 - A simple 2D scene
*  HW2 - A pong game
*  HW3 - Space Invaders
*  HW4 - Platformer game
*  HW5 - Adding sound to a previous assignment
*  Final - Emoji platformer [WIP]

### Final project specs.

Here are the requirements for the project:
*  Must have a title screen and proper states for game over, etc.
*  Must have a way to quit the game.
*  Must have music and sound effects.
*  Must have at least 3 different levels or be procedurally generated.
*  Must be either local multiplayer or have AI (or both!)
*  Must have at least some animation or particle effects.

I'll update this section later with details of the project I'm making.
